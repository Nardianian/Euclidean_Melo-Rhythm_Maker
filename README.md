Work in Progress, at this moment not finished, it does not work.

Project on Windows 11 Home using Juce 8.0.12 and Visual Studio 2026 Insiders: plugins and standalone for Windows x64. 
The project planning is still ongoing and subject to constant changes; it is currently planned to involves programming a MIDI generator for six independent euclidean rhythms with the following features:

A) Generation of 6 independent rhythms, in the form of six separate MIDI streams but linked to a global clock.

B) A single clock that drives all six rhythms simultaneously; the clock is selectable with separate options for plugins (DAW, Internal, External) and for standalone (Internal, External). 

C) The MIDI stream for each rhythm is generated based on various independent commands or rotary knobs, which in order on the GUI are:

   C1) Active: The selected rhythm is activated. Multiple selections are possible. Below the activation box are the “Mute,” “Solo,” and “Reset” boxes to activate the respective functions.

   C2) Note: to decide the singles Note or Scale or Chord to play. The single note allows you to choose the drum element with which to build that specific "rhythm" (hi-hat, tom, snare, kick, etc.), so it's suitable for 
       exclusively percussive instruments. The scale or chord is suitable for melodic instruments (synths, guitars, pianos, etc.) or melodic-percussive instruments such as metallophones (vibraphones, marimba, etc.)..
   
   C3) Steps: to decide the length of the rhythmic cycle.
   
   C4) Pulses: to decide how many active strokes are distributed across the steps using the euclidean algorithm.
   
   C5) Swing: to move certain steps forward (or backward), creating a more human feel.
   
   C6) Micro (Microtiming): to adjust very small timing shifts in notes to humanize the groove (more precise than swing).
   
   C7) Velocity (Velocity Accent): to control the dynamics of notes, their strength or intensity.
   
   C8) Note Len (Note Length): to set the duration of the MIDI note (with a different programming for the sixth rhythm on the seventh row).
   
D) ARP, the MIDI stream thus generated enters the arpeggiator:

   D1) If the arpeggiator is deactivated, the MIDI stream of the rhythm proceeds unchanged directly to its MIDI output following his Euclidean logic.
   
   D2) If the arpeggiator is activated, the ARP receives all the MIDI stream of the rhythm but only affects a portion of it, as follows:

   D3) Using "ARP Notes" button (the tickable popup menu with snapshot), user can view the incoming notes (the single notes or scales or chords chosen at the start of the rhythm or beginning of the row line, from the MIDI stream of the rhythm created so far) and can 
      select up to five or seven notes with their respective octaves (e.g., C-1, G#-7, etc.), simultaneously from all the notes received from the MIDI stream. Only the selected notes will be arpeggiated. Unselected notes continue unchanged, adding to the arpeggiated 
      notes. Notes generated by the rhythm but not selected in the arp behave as if the arp were not activated for those notes. The notes selected for the arpeggio and the unselected ones, of the same rhythm or line, are always added following the Euclidean logic in the 
      midi output

   D4) Use the "Mode" box/menu to select the mode (UP, DOWN, UP-DOWN, RANDOM) for arpeggiating the notes selected in the previous step (Arp-Notes).
   
   D5) Use "ARP Rate" to select the arpeggio speed of the selected notes in the previous step (Arp-Notes).
 
   To summarize the arpeggiator's action: the ARP reads all the notes it receives from the rhythm's MIDI stream, but from all of these, it chooses up to a maximum of five or seven selectable notes simultaneously and arpeggiates only these. In short, for each line, the rhythm proceeds unchanged EXCEPT for the selected notes, which will be arpeggiated. This arpeggio is therefore added to or superimposed on the rest of the rhythm with the unselected notes and together they are sent to the MIDI output following euclidean logic.
         
E) Finally, the rhythm thus created, including any possible arpeggio (if activate on some Rhythm channel), is output from a MIDI-Out whose port and channel can be selected: the goal of having independent outputs for each of the six rhythms is to have an app similar to a 
   multi-timbral virtual instrument, except that in this case it would be a MIDI utility designed to trigger a rhythm section, specifically the various elements of a drum kit and a bass (on the sixth rhythm, which has a different note length), but the possibility of 
   implementing options suitable for melodic instruments is being studied.

 The layout includes a first row with labels indicating the function of the elements below, arranged from left to right:
 
Active | Note | Steps | Pulses | Swing | Micro | Velocity | Note Len | Arp On | ARP Notes | Mode | ARP Rate | MIDI Port | MIDI Ch |

Below the row of labels are the six rows with the controls for each rhythm, the arpeggiator, and the MIDI output.
The controls on each row are, in order from left to right: a rhythm activation checkbox labeled R1 to R6 (Rhythm 1, Rhythm 2, etc.), then the seven rotary knobs for Note, Steps, Pulses, Swing, Microtiming, Velocity Accent, and Note Length, with boxes below each rotary encoder displaying the numerical value corresponding to the position of the encoder above it. Then there's the checkbox to enable ARP, then the tickable popup menu with snapshot/mask for selecting the seven notes/octaves to arpeggiate, then the combo box/menu for choosing the Mode, and the one for choosing the Rate.
Below sixth row R6 is a special "Bass" button to choose specific modes for the legato mono bass.
In the lower right corner of the window is the "Clock Settings" button/popup menu for choosing the clock.
At the bottom center there is the global PLAY button.
